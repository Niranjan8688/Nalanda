# Library Management System

This project is a library management system that includes  a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The system handles user management, book management, and a borrowing system.

## Features

- **List Books:** All users can view the list of books with pagination and filtering options (e.g., by genre, author).

### Borrowing System

### Reports and Aggregations
